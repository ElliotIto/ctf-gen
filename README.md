Tools and Scripts for CTF Challenge Generation

This is a side project for the creation of (for now) tools and scripts that would help with the creation of basic CTF Challenges. 

Writeups of CTFs from https://github.com/ctfs will be referenced for tools creating generic challenges that are similar.

----
## Usage
The tools and scripts are primarily being developed for Linux Distributions some of these tools and scripts could be ran in Windows but have not been tested. This limitation could be changed in the future.

Under each category, tool READMEs will provide examples of how to use the tool as well as the prerequisites. 

An example of this is below.
